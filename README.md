## Introduction
Cervical cancer is a type of cancer that affects the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that connects to the vagina. It is the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, with an estimated 570,000 new cases in 2018. Early detection and treatment of cervical cancer can significantly improve the chances of survival. Therefore, accurate prediction of cervical cancer is crucial for effective prevention and treatment.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Cervical Cancer Behavior Risk" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository The dataset contains 858 records of patients who were tested for cervical cancer. Each record has 36 attributes, including demographic information, medical history, and laboratory test results. The target variable is the presence or absence of cervical cancer.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of cervical cancer based on the patient's demographic information, medical history, and laboratory test results.

## Methodology
The project will follow the following methodology:
1. Data preprocessing: The dataset will be cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
2. Exploratory data analysis: The dataset will be analyzed to gain insights into the relationships between the variables and the target variable.
3. Feature engineering: New features will be created from the existing features to improve the predictive power of the model.
4. Model selection: Several machine learning models will be trained and evaluated to select the best model for the task.
5. Model evaluation: The selected model will be evaluated on a holdout dataset to estimate its performance on unseen data.
6. Model deployment: The final model will be deployed as a web application to allow users to input their demographic information, medical history, and laboratory test results and get a prediction of their risk of cervical cancer.

## Conclusion
This project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of cervical cancer based on the patient's demographic information, medical history, and laboratory test results. The final model will be deployed as a web application to allow users to get a prediction of their risk of cervical cancer. The project will follow a rigorous methodology that includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, model evaluation, and model deployment.
